UNREAL!","326":"You won't be disappointed.","327":"They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.","328":"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.","329":"When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.","330":"The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.","331":"Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.","332":"We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.","333":"Everything was gross.","334":"I love this place.","335":"Great service and food.","336":"First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!","337":"The burger...

andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.","392":"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.","393":"We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.","394":"Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.","395":"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.","396":"I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.","397":"Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!","398":"Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.","399":"Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.","400":"This one is simply a disappointment.","401":"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.","402":"I

any of the crust (teeth still sore).","416":"But now I was completely grossed out.","417":"I really enjoyed eating here.","418":"First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.","419":"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.","420":"From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.","421":"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.","422":"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!","423":"We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.","424":"What a mistake

appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.","434":"So absolutley fantastic.","435":"It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3\/4ths gristle and fat.","436":"definitely will come back here again.","437":"I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.","438":"Wow very spicy but delicious.","439":"If you're not familiar, check it out.","440":"I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.","441":"I'd love to go back.","442":"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast\/lunch.","443":"Nothing special.","444":"Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!","445":"Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!","446":"Will not be back.","447":"Sauce was tasteless.","448":"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.","449":"My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.","450":"I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.","451":"Food was so gooodd.","452":"I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.","453":"I was so insulted.","454":"The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.","455":"The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.","456":"The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.","457":"Nargile - I think you are great.","458":"Best tater tots in the southwest.","459":"We loved the place.","460":"Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.","461":"The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.","462":"Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.","463":"The manager was the worst.","464":"The inside is really quite nice and very clean.","465":"The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.","466":"I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.","467":"This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.","468":"Love the margaritas, too!","469":"This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.","470":"Very good, though!","471":"The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.","472":"Great pork sandwich.","473":"Don't waste your time here.","474":"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.","475":"Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.","476":"We enjoy their pizza and brunch.","477":"The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.","478":"We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.","479":"I LOVED it!","480":"We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.","481":"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.","482":"Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.","483":"The selection of food was not the best.","484":"Delicious and I will absolutely be back!","485":"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.","486":"They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.","487":"I dont think I will be back for a very long time.","488":"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.","489":"How awesome is that.","490":"I will be back many times soon.","491":"The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!","492":"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.","493":"CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.","494":"Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.","495":"And then tragedy struck.","496":"The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.","497":"This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!","498":"Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.","499":"Waitress was sweet and funny.","500":"I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with

happy you did.","512":"By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!","513":"Reasonably priced also!","514":"Everything was perfect the night we were in.","515":"The food is very good for your typical bar food.","516":"it was a drive to get there.","517":"At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.","518":"Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.","519":"Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.","520":"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.","521":"If you haven't gone here GO NOW!","522":"A greasy, unhealthy meal.","523":"first time there and might just be the last.","524":"Those burgers were amazing.","525":"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.","526":"And it was way to expensive.","527":"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.","528":"This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.","529":"The bartender was also nice.","530":"Everything was good and tasty!","531":"This place is two thumbs up....way up.","532":"The best place in

place.","534":"Terrible management.","535":"An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.","536":"If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.","537":"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.","538":"Worst martini ever!","539":"The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.","540":"I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing

was VERY disappointed!!","948":"This place is horrible and way overpriced.","949":"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.","950":"It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.","951":"The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.","952":"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.","953":"Con: spotty service.","954":"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.","955":"But then they came back cold.","956":"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.","957":"The real disappointment was our waiter.","958":"My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.","959":"The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.","960":"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.","961":"If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?","962":"She was

pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.","969":"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back \"ya'all\".","970":"I immediately said I

disapppointment with our entrees.","973":"The food wasn't good.","974":"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.","975":"What happened next was pretty....off putting.","976":"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.","977":"Overpriced for what you are getting.","978":"I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.","979":"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.","980":"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.","981":"We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.","982":"Food was below average.","983":"It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.","984":"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.","985":"The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).","986":"Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1\/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.","987":"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.","988":"It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.","989":"I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.","990":"The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.","991":"Spend your money and time some place else.","992":"A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.","993":"the presentation of the food was awful.","994":"I can't tell you how disappointed I was.","995":"I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.","996":"Appetite instantly gone.","997":"Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.","998":"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.","999":"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."},"target":{"0":1,"1":0,"2":0,"3":1,"4":1,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":0,"12":0,"13":1,"14":0,"15":0,"16":1,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":0,"27":1,"28":0,"29":0,"30":1,"31":0,"32":1,"33":0,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":0,"38":1,"39":0,"40":1,"41":0,"42":0,"43":1,"44":0,"45":1,"46":0,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":0,"54":1,"55":1,"56":0,"57":0,"58":1,"59":0,"60":0,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":0,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":0,"73":0,"74":0,"75":0,"76":0,"77":1,"78":1,"79":0,"80":0,"81":0,"82":0,"83":1,"84":0,"85":1,"86":0,"87":1,"88":1,"89":1,"90":0,"91":1,"92":0,"93":1,"94":0,"95":0,"96":1,"97":1,"98":0,"99":1,"100":1,"101":1,"102":1,"103":1,"104":1,"105":1,"106":1,"107":1,"108":1,"109":1,"110":0,"111":0,"112":1,"113":1,"114":1,"115":1,"116":0,"117":0,"118":0,"119":0,"120":0,"121":0,"122":1,"123":1,"124":1,"125":0,"126":0,"127":1,"128":0,"129":1,"130":0,"131":1,"132":1,"133":0,"134":1,"135":1,"136":1,"137":1,"138":0,"139":1,"140":0,"141":0,"142":0,"143":0,"144":1,"145":1,"146":0,"147":0,"148":0,"149":0,"150":1,"151":1,"152":0,"153":0,"154":1,"155":1,"156":1,"157":1,"158":1,"159":0,"160":0,"161":1,"162":1,"163":0,"164":1,"165":1,"166":1,"167":0,"168":0,"169":1,"170":0,"171":1,"172":1,"173":1,"174":1,"175":0,"176":0,"177":1,"178":1,"179":0,"180":0,"181":0,"182":0,"183":0,"184":1,"185":1,"186":0,"187":1,"188":1,"189":1,"190":1,"191":1,"192":0,"193":1,"194":0,"195":1,"196":0,"197":0,"198":1,"199":1,"200":1,"201":1,"202":0,"203":1,"204":1,"205":1,"206":0,"207":0,"208":0,"209":1,"210":0,"211":0,"212":1,"213":0,"214":1,"215":1,"216":0,"217":1,"218":0,"219":1,"220":0,"221":0,"222":0,"223":0,"224":0,"225":1,"226":1,"227":1,"228":0,"229":1,"230":1,"231":0,"232":1,"233":0,"234":1,"235":0,"236":0,"237":1,"238":0,"239":1,"240":0,"241":1,"242":0,"243":0,"244":0,"245":0,"246":1,"247":1,"248":1,"249":0,"250":1,"251":0,"252":1,"253":0,"254":1,"255":1,"256":1,"257":0,"258":1,"259":0,"260":1,"261":0,"262":1,"263":1,"264":1,"265":1,"266":0,"267":1,"268":1,"269":0,"270":1,"271":1,"272":1,"273":1,"274":1,"275":0,"276":1,"277":1,"278":0,"279":0,"280":1,"281":0,"282":0,"283":0,"284":1,"285":1,"286":0,"287":0,"288":1,"289":0,"290":0,"291":0,"292":1,"293":0,"294":1,"295":1,"296":0,"297":1,"298":0,"299":1,"300":1,"301":0,"302":0,"303":0,"304":1,"305":0,"306":0,"307":0,"308":1,"309":1,"310":1,"311":0,"312":1,"313":0,"314":1,"315":0,"316":0,"317":1,"318":1,"319":1,"320":0,"321":0,"322":1,"323":1,"324":1,"325":1,"326":1,"327":1,"328":0,"329":0,"330":0,"331":1,"332":1,"333":0,"334":1,"335":1,"336":0,"337":0,"338":1,"339":0,"340":0,"341":1,"342":1,"343":1,"344":0,"345":1,"346":1,"347":1,"348":1,"349":1,"350":0,"351":0,"352":1,"353":0,"354":1,"355":1,"356":0,"357":1,"358":1,"359":1,"360":0,"361":1,"362":1,"363":0,"364":1,"365":0,"366":0,"367":1,"368":1,"369":1,"370":0,"371":0,"372":1,"373":1,"374":0,"375":1,"376":0,"377":1,"378":0,"379":0,"380":0,"381":1,"382":1,"383":0,"384":0,"385":0,"386":1,"387":0,"388":0,"389":1,"390":1,"391":1,"392":1,"393":1,"394":1,"395":1,"396":0,"397":1,"398":1,"399":1,"400":0,"401":0,"402":0,"403":1,"404":1,"405":0,"406":1,"407":1,"408":1,"409":0,"410":1,"411":1,"412":0,"413":1,"414":0,"415":0,"416":0,"417":1,"418":1,"419":1,"420":1,"421":0,"422":0,"423":0,"424":0,"425":1,"426":1,"427":0,"428":0,"429":1,"430":0,"431":1,"432":1,"433":0,"434":1,"435":0,"436":1,"437":1,"438":1,"439":1,"440":0,"441":1,"442":1,"443":0,"444":1,"445":1,"446":0,"447":0,"448":1,"449":1,"450":0,"451":1,"452":0,"453":0,"454":0,"455":0,"456":1,"457":1,"458":1,"459":1,"460":0,"461":1,"462":1,"463":0,"464":1,"465":1,"466":0,"467":0,"468":1,"469":1,"470":1,"471":0,"472":1,"473":0,"474":0,"475":0,"476":1,"477":1,"478":1,"479":1,"480":0,"481":1,"482":0,"483":0,"484":1,"485":1,"486":1,"487":0,"488":0,"489":1,"490":1,"491":1,"492":0,"493":1,"494":1,"495":0,"496":1,"497":1,"498":1,"499":1,"500":1,"501":0,"502":1,"503":1,"504":1,"505":0,"506":0,"507":0,"508":0,"509":0,"510":1,"511":1,"512":1,"513":1,"514":1,"515":1,"516":0,"517":1,"518":0,"519":1,"520":1,"521":1,"522":0,"523":0,"524":1,"525":0,"526":0,"527":1,"528":1,"529":1,"530":1,"531":1,"532":1,"533":1,"534":0,"535":1,"536":0,"537":1,"538":0,"539":1,"540":1,"541":0,"542":1,"543":0,"544":0,"545":1,"546":1,"547":0,"548":0,"549":1,"550":1,"551":1,"552":1,"553":0,"554":0,"555":0,"556":0,"557":0,"558":1,"559":1,"560":0,"561":0,"562":1,"563":1,"564":1,"565":0,"566":0,"567":1,"568":0,"569":0,"570":0,"571":0,"572":0,"573":1,"574":1,"575":0,"576":0,"577":1,"578":1,"579":1,"580":0,"581":0,"582":0,"583":1,"584":0,"585":1,"586":1,"587":0,"588":1,"589":0,"590":1,"591":1,"592":1,"593":0,"594":0,"595":1,"596":0,"597":1,"598":1,"599":0,"600":1,"601":0,"602":1,"603":1,"604":1,"605":1,"606":1,"607":0,"608":1,"609":0,"610":0,"611":0,"612":0,"613":0,"614":1,"615":1,"616":0,"617":0,"618":1,"619":0,"620":0,"621":0,"622":1,"623":0,"624":1,"625":1,"626":0,"627":0,"628":0,"629":1,"630":1,"631":1,"632":0,"633":1,"634":0,"635":1,"63
